        <h1>FAQ</h1>
        <p><strong>What is the Internship Assessment System?</strong></p>
        <p>
          The Internship Assessment System is a platform designed to help companies and educational institutions track, manage, and evaluate intern performance. It's here to save you from the absolute circus of manual assessments and chaotic spreadsheet tracking.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Where do I register?</strong></p>
        <p>
          There isn’t a registration feature for this system. All accounts are created only by the Internship Officer to ensure that only verified email addresses are allowed to access certain features.
        </p>
        <p><strong>It’s my first time here. How can I get my password?</strong></p>
        <p>
          An email containing a link is sent to newly created accounts for users to create their password. You can click the “Receive an OTP (One-time Password)” button to check if your email has an associated account.
